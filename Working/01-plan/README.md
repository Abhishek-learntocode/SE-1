# Project 1 Execution Plan (Rolling Subtasks)

This folder tracks the step-by-step execution plan and artifacts for Project 1.

## Subtasks and Execution Order

### Phase 0 - Setup and Foldering
- [ ] Create a subfolder for each major task phase.

### Phase 1 - Task 1: Architectural Mapping and Design Recovery
- [ ] 1.1 Identify key classes in three subsystems.
- [ ] 1.2 Document functionality and interactions for each class.
- [ ] 1.3 Create UML diagrams (PlantUML).
- [ ] 1.4 Observations, assumptions, strengths/weaknesses.
- [ ] 1.5 Manual vs LLM analysis on a small subsystem portion.

### Phase 2 - Task 2: Smells and Metrics Analysis
- [ ] 2A. Design smells (5-7) using SonarQube + UML evidence.
- [ ] 2B. Metrics analysis (up to 6 metrics, include CK metrics).

### Phase 3 - Task 3: Refactoring
- [ ] 3A. Manual refactoring addressing design smells (class-level).
- [ ] 3B. Post-refactor metrics.
- [ ] 3C. LLM pipeline design (script + flowchart, not applied).

### Phase 4 - Task 4: Agentic Refactoring (single file)
- [ ] 4.1 Run agentic workflow on one file (document only).
- [ ] 4.2 Smell identification, plan, suggested refactor snippets.

### Phase 5 - Task 5: Comparative Analysis
- [ ] Compare 2-3 smells across Manual vs LLM vs Agentic.

## Notes
- Manual steps must be documented separately from LLM/agentic steps.
- Only manual refactorings are applied to codebase.
- Save all new outputs inside `Working/`.
